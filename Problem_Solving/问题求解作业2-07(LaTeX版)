\begin{problem}[CS 5.1.10]
\

How many five-card hands chosen from a standard deck of playing
cards consist of five cards in a row (such as the nine of diamonds,
ten of clubs, jack of clubs, queen of hearts, and king of spades)?
Such a hand is called a straight. What is the probability that a
five-card hand is a straight? Explore whether you get the same
answer by using five-element sets as your model of hands or
five-element permutations as your model of hands.

\end{problem}

\begin{solution} 
\

Leave out Joker, and consider ``10 j q k 1'' as row, then we have $10\times 4^{5}=10240$ kinds of row

Consider all the events, $C_52^5=2598960$, then we have probability that $p=\frac{10240}{2598960}=\frac{128}{32487}\approx0.00394$

The answer is same as using five-element sets or five-element permutation.

\end{solution}

\begin{problem}[CS 5.1.12]
\

A dice is made of a cube with a square painted on one side, a circle
on two sides, and a triangle on three sides. If the die is rolled
twice, what is the probability that the two shapes you see on top
are the same?

\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
\

Consider the square $1\times1=1$

Consider the circle $2\times2=4$

Consider the triangle $3\times3=9$

Then the probability is $p=\frac{1+4+9}{6\times6}=\frac{7}{18}\approx0.39$

The probability of at least one is red or white is $p=1-\frac{C_2^2}{C_6^2}=1-\frac{1}{15}=\frac{14}{15}$

The probability of at least one is red is $p=1-\frac{C_4^2}{C_6^2}=1-\frac{6}{15}=\frac{3}{5}$

If you are hashing $n$ keys into a hash table with $k$ locations, what is
the probability that every location gets at least one key?

\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
\

If $k>n$, then there is no probability that every location gets at least one key.

If $k=n$, then the probability is $p=\frac{n!}{n^n}$

If $k<n$, then the probability is $p=\frac{\sum_{i=0}^{k}(-1)^{i}C_{k}^{i}(k-i)^n}{k^n}$

In three flips of a coin, is the event that two flips in a row are heads
independent of the event that there is an even number of heads?

\end{problem}

\begin{solution} 
\

No, the event that two flips in a row are heads is not independent of the event that there an even number of heads.

\begin{problem}[CS 5.3.6]
\

Assume that on a true-false test, students will answer correctly any
question on a subject that they know. Assume students guess at answers
they do not know. For students who know $60\%$ of the material in a
course, what is the probability that they will answer a question
correctly? What is the probability that they will know the answer to a
question they answer correctly?

\end{problem}

\begin{solution} 
\

$P(A)=0.6+0.4\times 0.5=0.8$ so the probability that they will answer a question correctly is $0.8$

The probability that they will know the answer to a question they answer correctly is $P=\frac{0.6}{0.8}=\frac{3}{4}=0.75$

In a family consisting of a mother, father, and two children of different
ages, what is the probability that the family has two girls, given that one
of the children is a girl? What is the probability that the children are
both boys, given that the older child is a boy?

\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
\

The probability that family has two girls, given that one of the children is a girl is $P(twog\|oneg)=\frac{P(twog)}{P(oneg)}=\frac{\frac{1}{4}}{\frac{3}{4}}=\frac{1}{3}$

The probability that the children are both boys, given that the older child is a boy is $P(twog\|olderg)=\frac{P(twog)}{P(olderg)}=\frac{\frac{1}{4}}{\frac{2}{4}}=\frac{1}{2}$

\begin{problem}[CS 5.4.4]
\

Assuming that the process of answering the questions on a
five-question quiz is an independent trials process and that a student has
a probability .8 of answering any given question correctly, what is the
probability of one particular sequence of four correct answers and one
incorrect answer? What is the probability that a student answers exactly
four questions correctly?

\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
\

The probability of one particular sequence of four correct answers and one incorrect answer is $P=0.8^4\times0.2^1=0.08192$

The probability that a student answers exactly four questions correctly is $P=C_{5}^{4}\times0.8^4\times0.2^1=0.4096$

\begin{problem}[CS 5.4.10]

What is the expected value of the constant random variable $X$ that has
$X(s) = c$ for every member $s$ of the sample space? (We frequently use
$c$ to stand for this random variable. Thus, this question is asking for
$E(c)$.)

\end{problem}
    
\begin{solution}
\

$E(c)=\sum_{s:s\in S}X(s)P(s)=\sum_{s:s\in S}cP(s)=c$

\begin{problem}[CS 5.4.12]

Solve Problem 11 for the case of a student taking a multiple-choice test
with five choices for each answer and randomly guessing when she
doesn’t know the answer.

\end{problem}
    
\begin{solution}
\

Because there are five choices for each answer so randomly guessing will have $\frac{1}{5}$ probability to answer correctly.

$X+(1-X)\times\frac{1}{5}-y\times(1-X)\times\frac{4}{5}=X$

So if we let $y=\frac{1}{4}$, then we can make its expected value to be the percentage of the material being tested that the student knows.

Prove Theorem 5.11.

\begin{solution}
\

$E(cX)=\sum_{s:s\in S}(cX(s))P(s)=c\sum_{s:s\in S}X(s)P(s)=cE(X)$

so Theorem 5.11 has been proved.
